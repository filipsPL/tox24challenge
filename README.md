Tox24 Challenge Dataset
===========

This repository contains molecular structures and descriptors for the Tox24 challenge prepared by me (team name: **filipsPL**). The goal of the challenge was to predict the in vitro activity of compounds' activity against [Transthyretin (TTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin) using chemical structure data.

## Dataset

This repository includes:

- The chemical structures in SMILES format, provided by the organizers and curated by me using my RDKit pipeline `data/smiles_org+fixed.csv`.
- Training set - a diversified set of 1000 compounds, used for training models `data/train.csv.xz`
- Validation set: a diversified set of 100 compounds, used for final validation of models `data/validation.csv.xz`
- Test set: 500 compounds used to make predictions. It contains a leaderboard set (200 compounds) and a blind set (300 compounds) `data/test.csv.xz`. ðŸ’¡ This set contains compounds with known and unknown activity. Compounds with known activity are also the members of the Training/Validation set.

## Descriptors
